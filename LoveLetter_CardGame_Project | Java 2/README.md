# Love Letter Card Game - Programming 2 Project
This repository contains my Love Letter Card Game, a project developed during my Programming 2 class at Dawson College. It showcases my growing proficiency in Java programming and serves as an example of an object-oriented approach to designing and implementing interactive applications.
This project builds upon the foundational programming skills introduced in my earlier coursework, with a focus on advanced concepts such as object-oriented design, encapsulation, and inheritance.

## Concepts Demonstrated
This project demonstrates the following key programming concepts:

- Object-Oriented Design: Applying encapsulation, inheritance, and object-oriented methodology to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
- Class Implementation and Interaction: Designing and implementing multiple interacting classes to represent players, cards, and game mechanics.
- Interactive Processing: Facilitating user interactions through prompts and dynamic game flow.
- Array and String Processing: Utilizing arrays and strings to manage the game's state and validate user actions.
- Data Validation: Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of player inputs and game logic.
